# Snake Game Project

A simple web-based Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run
1. Open `snake_game/snake_game.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself to keep the game going.

## Project Structure
- `snake_game/`: Contains the game files (`snake_game.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`).
- `docs/`: Documentation (this file).
- `assets/`: For static files like images (if needed).

## Future Enhancements
- Add high-score tracking.
- Implement different difficulty levels.
- Add sound effects.
