## Abstract
Hydrogen plays a significant role in reducing carbon emissions in industries and transportation. However, hydrogen production via electrolysis creates interdependencies between hydrogen supply chains and electricity systems. This study links an electrolytic hydrogen supply chain model with an electricity system dispatch model, focusing on Germany in 2030. Key findings include:

1. **Impact of Electricity Prices**: Hydrogen infrastructure investments and their effects on the electricity system are strongly influenced by electricity prices. Current uniform pricing increases congestion costs by 17%.
2. **Spatial Price Signals**: Passing spatially resolved electricity price signals leads to electrolyzers being placed at low-cost grid nodes, reducing end-use costs for hydrogen and congestion management costs by up to 20%.
3. **Policy Implications**: The study advocates for spatially differentiated economic signals to optimize hydrogen production and reduce costs, suggesting potential subsidies based on spatial criteria.

## Key Takeaways
- **Cross-Sectoral Analysis**: The study provides a holistic view of hydrogen integration into electricity systems, emphasizing the need for coordinated policy and investment strategies.
- **Economic Efficiency**: Spatially resolved pricing can significantly lower costs and improve efficiency in hydrogen production and electricity grid management.
- **Future Research**: The findings highlight the importance of further research into dynamic pricing models and their scalability across different regions.

## Conclusion
The study underscores the importance of spatial economic signals in optimizing hydrogen production and electricity system performance. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage these insights to design more efficient and cost-effective hydrogen infrastructure investments.
