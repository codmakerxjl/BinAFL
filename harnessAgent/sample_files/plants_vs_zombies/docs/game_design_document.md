# Game Design Document: Plants vs. Zombies (Web Version)

## **1. Introduction**
This document outlines the detailed design of the web-based "Plants vs. Zombies" game, building upon the initial structure and requirement analysis. It covers game mechanics, levels, characters (plants and zombies), and the scoring system.

## **2. Game Mechanics**

### **Core Gameplay**
- **Objective**: Defend the player's house from waves of zombies using strategically placed plants.
- **Grid System**: The lawn is divided into a grid where plants can be placed and zombies move from right to left.

- **Level 2**: Introduction to Wall-nuts and Conehead Zombies.
- **Level 3**: Cherry Bomb and Buckethead Zombies.
- **Level 4+**: Mixed zombie types, faster waves, and new plant unlocks.

### **Level Design**
- **Grid Layout**: 5 rows x 9 columns.
- **Waves**: Each level has 3-5 waves, with increasing zombie numbers and types.
