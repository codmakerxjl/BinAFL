The paper titled "ReSym: Harnessing LLMs to Recover Variable and Data Structure Symbols from Stripped Binaries" was not found in the provided arXiv link. The link instead references a paper titled "DiffNAS: Bootstrapping Diffusion Models by Prompting for Better Architectures" by Wenhao Li et al., which focuses on optimizing diffusion models for synthetic data generation using GPT-4 as a supernet for architecture search.

If you have additional details or a direct link to the "ReSym" paper, I can assist further in summarizing its methods and conclusions.
