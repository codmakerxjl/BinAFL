# Chess Game Deployment

This directory contains the deployed files for the professional web-based chess game. Below is an overview of the files and their purposes:

### Files:
1. **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the chess game webpage.
2. **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file handling the game logic, including piece movement and interactions.
3. **`style.css`**: The CSS file styling the chessboard and pieces for a professional and visually appealing layout.

### How to Run:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the chess game.
2. The game supports local multiplayer (hotseat mode) and includes a clean, responsive design.

### Notes:
- Ensure all files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`) are in the same directory for the game to function correctly.
- No additional server setup is required for local play.

For further enhancements (e.g., online multiplayer, AI opponent), refer to the previous subtask results for integration steps.
