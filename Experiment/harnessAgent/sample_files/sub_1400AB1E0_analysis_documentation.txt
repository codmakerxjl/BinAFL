# Documentation for sub_1400AB1E0 Function Analysis

## Restored Variables and Types
Based on the analysis and restoration process, the following variables in `sub_1400AB1E0` have been identified and renamed for clarity:

### Input Parameters:
1. **p_object**: `_DWORD *` (Pointer to an object or structure)
   - Usage: Derived from `a1`, used in pointer arithmetic and dereferencing.
2. **param1**: `int` (First parameter, purpose unclear without further context)
3. **param2**: `int` (Second parameter, purpose unclear without further context)
4. **param3**: `unsigned int` (Third parameter, used in conditional checks)

### Local Variables:
1. **p_object_data**: Derived from `p_object`, likely holds object data.
2. **object_size**: Holds a size value derived from `p_object`.
3. **result_value**: `int` (Holds the result of a function call and is returned).
4. **flag1**, **flag2**, **flag3**: Used in bitwise operations, likely flags.
5. **default_size**: Holds a constant value `16`, likely a default size.

## Function Prototype Update
The function prototype has been updated to reflect the restored variables and types:
```c
int __fastcall sub_1400AB1E0(
    _DWORD *p_object,      // Pointer to an object/structure
    int param1,            // First parameter (purpose unclear)
    int param2,            // Second parameter (purpose unclear)
    unsigned int param3    // Third parameter (used in conditional checks)
);
```

## Verification of Consistency
- All restored variables and types have been cross-checked with the function's pseudocode and external references.
- No inconsistencies were found; the restored names and types align with the function's logic and usage.

## Additional Insights
- The function appears to manipulate an object (`p_object`) and perform size-related checks (`object_size`, `default_size`).
- The use of flags (`flag1`, `flag2`, `flag3`) suggests conditional branching based on bitwise operations.
- The return value (`result_value`) is likely a status code or result of the operation.

## Next Steps
- Further analysis could focus on the purpose of `param1` and `param2` if additional context becomes available.
- Review cross-references to `sub_1400AB1E0` to understand its role in the larger codebase.
