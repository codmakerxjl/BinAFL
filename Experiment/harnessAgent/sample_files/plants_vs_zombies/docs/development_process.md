# Development Process Documentation

## Overview
This document details the design and development process of the web-based "Plants vs. Zombies" game, including challenges faced and solutions implemented. It builds upon the results of previous subtasks, such as requirement analysis, game design, UI/UX design, frontend and backend development, integration, testing, and deployment.

---

## **1. Project Initiation**
### **Goals**
- Create a visually appealing and responsive web-based "Plants vs. Zombies" game.
- Implement core gameplay mechanics (plant placement, zombie waves, resource management).
- Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
- Deploy the game to a scalable and accessible platform.

### **Initial Setup**
- Created the project structure in `sample_files/plants_vs_zombies` with directories for assets, CSS, JavaScript, and documentation.
- Drafted `design_notes.md` to outline the technical stack and design goals.

---

## **2. Requirement Analysis**
### **Key Requirements**
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Defined plant and zombie types, level progression, and win/lose conditions.
- **UI/UX**: Designed intuitive screens (main menu, game screen, level selection).
- **Technical**: Outlined the game loop, collision detection, and backend APIs.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Balancing plant and zombie attributes for fair gameplay.
  - **Solution**: Iterative testing and adjustments to health, attack power, and speed.

---

## **3. Game Design**
### **Design Document**
- Created `game_design_document.md` in the `docs` folder, detailing:
  - Plant and zombie behaviors.
  - Level design and wave mechanics.
  - Scoring and resource management.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring level difficulty progression.
  - **Solution**: Introduced new zombie types and plant unlocks in later levels.

---

## **4. UI/UX Design**
### **Wireframes and Mockups**
- Designed wireframes for all screens (main menu, game screen, etc.).
- Ensured responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Adapting the grid layout for smaller screens.
  - **Solution**: Used CSS media queries to adjust grid dimensions dynamically.

---

## **5. Frontend Development**
### **Implementation**
- Expanded `index.html` and `style.css` for all UI screens.
- Developed `game.js` to handle:
  - Plant placement and zombie movement.
  - Sun collection and collision detection.
  - Game loop and event handling.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Performance lag during zombie waves.
  - **Solution**: Optimized the game loop and reduced redundant DOM updates.

---

## **6. Backend Development**
### **API Endpoints**
- Implemented authentication (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`).
- Added game state management (`/game/save`, `/game/load`).
- Created leaderboard functionality (`/leaderboard/submit`, `/leaderboard/get`).

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Securing user data.
  - **Solution**: Used JWT for authentication and password hashing.

---

## **7. Integration**
### **Frontend-Backend Communication**
- Updated `game.js` to call backend APIs for:
  - User authentication.
  - Saving/loading game states.
  - Leaderboard submissions.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Handling API errors gracefully.
  - **Solution**: Added user-friendly error messages in the UI.

---

## **8. Testing and Debugging**
### **Testing Strategies**
- Manual testing for gameplay and UI.
- Automated testing for critical JavaScript functions.
- Performance testing using browser tools.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Zombies not taking damage.
  - **Solution**: Fixed collision detection logic in `game.js`.

---

## **9. Deployment**
### **Hosting**
- Deployed frontend to Netlify.
- Deployed backend to Heroku.
- Configured a custom domain with SSL.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge**: Scaling backend for high traffic.
  - **Solution**: Implemented horizontal scaling and caching.

---

## **10. Lessons Learned**
- **Iterative Design**: Frequent testing and feedback were crucial for balancing gameplay.
- **Performance Optimization**: Early profiling prevented major bottlenecks.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs streamlined collaboration and maintenance.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Add multiplayer features.
- Expand the plant and zombie roster.
- Enhance animations and sound effects.
